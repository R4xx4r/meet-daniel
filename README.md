> Welcome to my personal portfolio page.
> Welcome to [https://meetdaniel.netlify.com/](https://meetdaniel.netlify.com/)

This page is built with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and created via [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/). For more infos take a look at their pages. They have great docs! :thumbsup: :muscle: 
<br>
Also I decided to deploy it via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), because it's so so easy und just cool! 

## Deployment process
As I mentioned before I deploy my app via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). For this I work in two branches. The `master` branch which will be deployed automatically if I push something in it and the `development` branch, where I try to create all the magic :wink:

## Project setup
It's really simple, or at least I hope it is :wink:

```bash 
$ git clone git@github.com:R4xx4r/meet-daniel.git [PATH_TO_YOUR_DIR]
$ cd [PATH_TO_YOUR_DIR]
$ npm i
```

## NPM scripts
After installing our project you have some npm scripts available:

| command | description |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| `npm run serve` | Compiles and hot-reloads for development |
| `npm run build` | Compiles and minifies for production |
| `npm run lint` | Lints and fixes files |


## Customize configuration
If you wanna adapt the basic configuration to your needs take a look at [Vue CLI configuration reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
